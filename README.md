# iDisguise
Plugin for CraftBukkit and Spigot

**This project is abandoned since November 2018!**

## Basic information
This plugin allows you to turn into almost every entity that exists in Minecraft.  
More information can be found here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/idisguise.5509/

## Snapshot files
Compiled snapshot files may be downloaded over here: https://www.robingrether.de/idisguise/

## GitHub repository
As of October 2017 the master branch always holds a (hopefully) bug-free recommended release version of iDisguise, whereas small changes (such as bug fixes etc.) get pushed to the snapshot branch until they are released officially.
So if you would like to develop your own fork of this repository, make sure to build it upon the master branch to ensure best performance and proper functionality.
